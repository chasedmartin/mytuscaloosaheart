Scrubs was a sitcom that aired from 2001 to 2009 ([cough cough](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/scrubs/s09)). It was a formative show for me since it was running during my teenage years. A good friend I had at the time was a bigger fan of the show and we'd watch it together every once in a while, make references, and generally bond over it. Even though I enjoyed watching it when it was on I didn't watch it regularly enough to consider myself a super fan. Watching TV really wasn't my kind of thing in general. I was and continue to be a much bigger fan of movies and the movie experience.

It wasn't until college that I decided to watch the series from the beginning. I didn't have either an active Netflix account or a Scrubs DVD collection. I improvised by watching all of the episodes on YouTube. Thanks to YouTube needing to crack down on copyrighted material on their service, people were forced to get creative with how they uploaded the show. Instead of just uploading the episodes in their entirety, episodes were split into three different segments. This is how I watched the first four or five seasons of Scrubs, 8 minute slices at a time.

As I was going through the first season, I noticed something interesting. The [ninetieth episode of the series](https://trakt.tv/shows/scrubs/seasons/1/episodes/18) was titled "My Tuscaloosa Heart." Obviously I found this coincidental since I was watching from my apartment bedroom in Northport, AL just a few miles away from The University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa, AL. The episode is titled after the B-plot throughout the episode where Elliot and Turk discover a music track they believe to be performed by Dr. Kelso singing about his "Bunny." It's important to understand that Kelso, especially in the first season, is the antagonist and general old grumpy man of the show. After another hint dropped by Kelso himself, Elliot is convinced that it was in fact him in the recording. When finally confronted by their curiosity, Kelso denies the allegations. However, when alone in his office we see [he had indeed lied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZsFxk_aoc0). It's a sweet side plot that starts to lay the foundation for the warmer side of Kelso in later seasons.

Like I mentioned earlier, I was attending college in Tuscaloosa at the time. I found the coincidence quite humorous. I tried googling to make sure there wasn't any other Tuscaloosa that it might be referencing. If it was, I never found it and it hardly matters now. A few years later, I bought the domain. Recently, I expanded my domain ownership and decided to use it as my personal website/blog. Is it a brand? I'm not sure. But it's mine and it's a fun reference to my excellent college years. A little piece of my heart will always stay in Tuscaloosa.
